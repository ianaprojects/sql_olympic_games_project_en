# SQL Analysis of the Olympic Games in Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing Olympic Games data using SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to demonstrate skills in SQL for data extraction, filtering, grouping, and aggregation.

## Objectives
- Practice writing SQL queries.
- Analyze Olympic Games data.
- Address tasks such as identifying medal leaders and analyzing country participation.
- Prepare a report with SQL queries and results in Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Sources
The dataset "120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results" is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?select=athlete_events.csv). It contains data on athletes and their Olympic results over the past 120 years, loaded into a local PostgreSQL database.

## Methodology
SQL queries, including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY, are used for data analysis. Results are presented interactively in Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
- Developed SQL querying skills for Olympic data analysis.
- Provided insights on Olympic events and participating countries.
- Identified top medal-winning countries and overall medal counts.

## Tools and Technologies
- SQL: for query writing and data analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook: for interactive results presentation.
- jupysql, psycopg2: for PostgreSQL database connection.
